= EarthCube Advancing netCDF-CF Project

The main goals of the EarthCube "Advancing netCDF-CF for the
Geoscience Community" project are to work with the existing netCDF-CF
community to:

* Increase the range of geoscience domains using netCDF-CF and active
  in the community
* Extend the netCDF-CF standard to support data from a wider range of
  geoscience domains
* Collaborate with other standards groups such as the OGC, ESIP, RDA,
  and NASA ESDS

The project will gather scientific use-cases and example datasets to
guide the drafting of documents detailing enhancements to the CF
standard. Close collaboration with the existing netCDF-CF community
and engagement with new geoscience domains as well as other standards
groups will lead to strong community agreement around the proposed
enhancements.
